### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Node.js and npm:** (LTS version recommended) - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **Python:** (Version 3.8+ recommended) - [Download Python](https://www.python.org/)
*   **PostgreSQL:** (Ensure the server is running) - [Download PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
*   **Git:** For cloning the repository - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/)

###  Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/fullstack-blog-app.git
    cd fullstack-blog-app
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup (`backend/` directory):**
    ```bash
    cd backend

    # Create and activate a Python virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    # venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    # source venv/bin/activate

    # Install backend dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Create a .env file in the 'backend' directory (copy from .env.example if provided, or create manually)
    # Add your PostgreSQL database credentials and a Django SECRET_KEY:
    # Example backend/.env:
    # DJANGO_SECRET_KEY='your_strong_random_secret_key'
    # DEBUG=True
    # DB_NAME=blog_app_db
    # DB_USER=blog_app_user
    # DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
    # DB_HOST=localhost
    # DB_PORT=5432

    # Set up your PostgreSQL database:
    # 1. Ensure PostgreSQL server is running.
    # 2. Create a database (e.g., 'blog_app_db') and a user (e.g., 'blog_app_user') with privileges.
    #    (Refer to PostgreSQL documentation or the project's setup phase for commands)

    # Apply database migrations
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate

    # Create a superuser (optional, for Django admin panel access)
    python manage.py createsuperuser

    # Run the backend development server (usually on http://127.0.0.1:8000)
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup (`frontend/blog_ui/` directory):**
    *(Open a new terminal for this, or navigate from the project root)*
    ```bash
    cd frontend/blog_ui

    # Install frontend dependencies
    npm install

    # Create a .env file in the 'frontend/blog_ui' directory
    # Add the backend API URL:
    # Example frontend/blog_ui/.env:
    # VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api

    # Run the frontend development server (usually on http://localhost:5173)
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Access the Application:**
    *   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port your frontend server is running on).
